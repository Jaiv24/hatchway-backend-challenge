# Hatchway-Backend-Challenge
  Backend Challenge at Hatchways.
  
### Summary
 - This application contains the results of a challenge Hatchways.
 - The challenge is entirely focused on the backend and uses an external API, as a result I have not used my own database.
 - tests are found in test/test-page.js

### Requirements

```
Node 14.16.0
Nodemon 2.0.7
```

### Steps to Operate
- In the terminal and within the project directory run `npm install`
- This server will run on `PORT=5001`
- Run `npm start` to start the server, which will be at `localhost:5001`
- Step-1 result will be found at localhost:5001/api/ping
- Step-2 result will be found at localhost:5001/api/posts/:tags/:sortBy?/:direction?
- For example you main insert http://localhost:5001/api/posts/history,tech/likes/desc to get a result.
Or simply http://localhost:5001/api/posts/history,tech
- Run `npm test` to see the passing tests in the terminal
- I used `Thunder Client` Visual Studio extention to verify all of my solutions.
